WHAT IT DOES

It helps customers log their complaints and allows customer care assistants to monitor and change the status of those complaints
 
The Customer Complaint Service project has the two login tabs on the main page (one for customer other for assistant)

The customer logs in and has the privilege to Add complaints. He/she can also view them on the main screen after login.
Considering the same customer might have multiple complaints over a period of time, the customer can search his/her complaints on the
basis of department(Medical/Admin/Transport) and status of complaints(open/closed/working)

The assistant logs in and can view the complaints of all users. He/she can see the present status and edit the complaint body and status 
using the Edit status button
He/she also has the privilege to search via department and status
